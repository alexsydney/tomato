This library does a lot of arbitrary mixing of C and C++. That's inherently dangerous. Following is one VERY IMPORTANT
consideration to bear in mind regarding C++ objects with nontrivial destructors (i.e. V8!):

It's worse than that; if ruby longjmps over the destruction of an
automatic object, the program has undefined behavior.  And if a C++
exception ever leaves C++ code and goes into Ruby code, the result will
also be undefined.

C99 programmers also have to be careful; longjmping over the destruction
of a variable-length array can result in a memory leak.
